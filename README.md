# k4tool

Utility to work with Kawai K4 synthesizer patches.

## Usage

You will need the [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) 3.1 or later from Microsoft to run this program.

When you have installed .NET Core and cloned the repository from GitHub, change to the prorgram
directory and issue the command

    dotnet run

The program will start and show you its command line options.

## Disclaimer

This is not a polished end-user product. Use it at your own risk. If it works for you, great.
If it doesn't, you can improve it or fix it if you know how to program in C# for .NET.

You can also send suggestions for improvements of features, but I can't promise to do anything
about them.
